Social Network API

Description
This is a NoSQL-based social network API built using MongoDB, Express.js, and Mongoose. The API allows users to:
- Create an account
- Share their thoughts
- React to friendsâ€™ thoughts
- Add and remove friends from their friend list

This API is tested using Insomnia, and all CRUD operations for users, thoughts, reactions, and friends have been implemented.
